# Midjourney Archive Chrome Extension

> ðŸš¨ Midjourney released a new website which killed access to the archive
endpoints. This means this extension will only work as long as
[legacy.midjourney.com](https://legacy.midjourney.com) is online. Consider
bringing this to the attention of the MJ team by posting about it in their
[Discord](https://discord.gg/midjourney).

I got a bit tired of Midjourney's limited and buggy archive download solution so
I decided to put together a quick and dirty chrome extension with GPT-4.

Make sure you're logged into Midjourney, otherwise this won't work.

## Metadata

Metadata for each job can be found in the `archived_jobs.json` file that gets
added to each generated zip file. To associate jobs to the image files, I've
added an `_archvied_files` attribute to each job that contains the downloaded image file names.

[@GanWeaving](https://twitter.com/ganweaving) put together a
[python script](https://github.com/GanWeaving/inject-midjourney-command) that converts the images to JPEG and injects the metadata into the EXIF data.

## TODO

[ ] Add image settings (prompt, aspect ratio etc) as metadata/properties directly to the png images.

## Development

After modifying `src/popup.js`, run `npm run build` to update `dist/popup.js`.
